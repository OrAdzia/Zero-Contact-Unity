# Zero Contact

Disclaimer:
This project was originally inspired by a course from GameDev.tv.
As a personal challenge, I decided to fully rebuild the project from scratch, applying what I learned to create my own version and test my understanding after completing the course.

Zero Contact is a precision flying game built with Unity.  
You pilot a rocket through dangerous obstacle courses where one mistake sends you back to the start.
